## Summary

This episode by Sunil Pai covers Okay, we're here with Sunil Pai, creator of Code Mode. But like, do do you end up with that problem with skills where you have to start getting more and more specific, at which point you're like, I might as well just express it as code? Thank you for dropping by and thank you for sharing.

## Key Points

1. Okay, we're here with Sunil Pai, creator of Code Mode.
2. And it runs with serverless characteristics instead of spinning up a whole VM.
3. We're like, we don't even know the shape of what's going to happen and while that needs to run in a sandboxed environment, we do have ideas on how to expose capabilities and an intelligence layer via the harness.
4. You you are you are you are happy to indulge in a lot of different ranging topics.
5. And I was like, oh, of course I want to make some of this stuff work with Cloudflare.
6. Yeah, let's talk about slow up forks for a while, right?
7. And then you take it, you change it, you share something.
8. Uh for for a remote code that's called it.

## Transcript

Okay, we're here with Sunil Pai, creator of Code Mode. &gt;&gt; No, I do take credit for creation of Code Mode. Dynamic Isolates have been &gt;&gt; no, you said &gt;&gt; I did create it. It's mine. I It is I did create Since Since I was a child, I was I've been thinking about it. It's my life's It's my life's mission. &gt;&gt; I wanted to just catch up on everything going on in Cloudflare lands and also like you obviously you and I have caught up over the years.

The more recent thing which just launched yesterday was this Cloud Cloud Manage Agents thing which I which I know that you're you're also like interested in. Maybe we can talk about that cuz it's kind of like breaking news and you seem excited about it. &gt;&gt; Cloud Manage Agents is dope because Anthropic is saying here is a platform for you to build and deploy your agents that are like long-running. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; And I like it because I like the people at Anthropic and they're super ambitious about these things. Except I looked at the product and I was like I think I want to compete. I think we can do something better with Workers and Durable Objects. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Cloudflare is the is an ideal platform for this. You have workflows for a while. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

&gt;&gt; What is what functionalities are available in Cloudflare? Like why can't you just come on and say yeah, we we already had this? Like what what's the difference? &gt;&gt; I think &gt;&gt; that you see. &gt;&gt; Like anything else, I think we are like discovering the architecture of the new architecture of building software of which I'm talking about on stage in a couple of hours. 5:40 p.m. Please show up to the main stage.

But interestingly, our primitive The two primitives that I think are critical that I suspect every platform will eventually get. One is Durable Objects which are stateful serverless programming. I think that's a true innovation. It's the world's first implementation of the actor model in an in an infrastructure layer, not in user land. It means you can spin up millions of these stateful things that run in the background, etc.

And it runs with serverless characteristics instead of spinning up a whole VM. That's one. The second which we announced just a few weeks ago is what we call Dynamic Workers. Famously, eval has been considered a bad idea evaluating code user generated code or now LLM generated code, but we built this thing that lets you run it in a safe environment with zero startup time. And when I say safe, I mean you can expose only the APIs that you want into it and you can control all outgoing traffic.

In fact, the default way we recommend people using it is to cancel all outgoing traffic and only use the exposed endpoints. So, given these things, we feel we can build a much more efficient and much a new kind of architecture for building AI agents. One of applications of dynamic workers, we made a little noise about it a while ago, is my colleague Matt Carey built our MCP server. The Cloudflare API is 2600 API endpoints. So, if you expose the tool for each one of them, you're screwed.

And you could say, "Oh, I'm going to do progressive disclosure. I'm going to do this." No. We said you can have two tool calls. One is search and execute. And to each one of these you actually submit code that we run in an isolate.

So, you can say, "Here's some JavaScript code that searches the entire open API JSON." And the second time you can say, "Here's some code to actually run that hey, find all my workers, find the DNS things they're used in." And if it starts with the letter Z, then apply DDoS protection for it. In one tool call, no back and forth with the LLM, and it's type checked, and well, turns out LLMs are great at running code. So, this is fundamental capabilities.

It's not something you can patch on and use it and so, that makes me excited about Cloudflare for the future of agentic software. &gt;&gt; I I don't know if you've you've looked at sort of Cloud managed agents thing. &gt;&gt; I looked briefly. There's like interesting takes, right? So, separate the context from what's happening and then there's like a little quote about okay, recursive models do this. Any any takes on that? &gt;&gt; I do like their thing.

They made a point of pointing out that the harness runs separate like from the execution environment because they're preparing for a world of software that hasn't existed in the past. What a wonderful way of looking towards the future, by the way. It's not that you're just going to build the next crud API.

We're like, we don't even know the shape of what's going to happen and while that needs to run in a sandboxed environment, we do have ideas on how to expose capabilities and an intelligence layer via the harness. I think that's like excellent.

&gt;&gt; Do you think that becomes sort of standardized like Cloudflare is someone that would probably plug in support? Is there a standard unified layer around that? Is there bits you take different ways that you see it? Like everyone is building for a version of the future of software engines. Uh, do you have a vision that you see? &gt;&gt; It's so hard, but the way I'm framing it in my head is no one has built the React yet.

You know, like the moment React came in, it wasn't I mean, it annoyed a bunch of people because it seemed so different. The fact that you can build uh, describe a component tree with XML. I I don't know if you remember in 2013, people were walking out of the talk while they were introducing the thing saying Facebook hates JavaScript, but that is that established every framework in the future and React is still massive.

I suspect we everyone Now everyone is building a harness and everyone's like, well, it should be in this shape. It should be in that shape. Uh, someone needs to come out with some original thinking around something that is reproducible across languages, across companies, across infrastructure. I suspect we haven't done that yet. &gt;&gt; It might just be skills. I feel like skills are the ultimate translation. &gt;&gt; And they're they're a version where &gt;&gt; It's just English.

&gt;&gt; They scale well. It's English. Uh, you know, you can abstract it down. You can create skills on their own. &gt;&gt; Is that it? Like By the way, I'd be so happy if you say the future of software is markdown files. Beautiful. Instantly accessible. A multi-language bridges the world. Uh, could just be skills.

But like, do do you end up with that problem with skills where you have to start getting more and more specific, at which point you're like, I might as well just express it as code? &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. I'm being very precise about my my stuff. Um yeah, I mean, and skills bundle code as well, right? So, there's a whole whole bunch of things. Okay, there's I mean, there's other topics that we can also touch on. You you are you are you are happy to indulge in a lot of different ranging topics.

Let's talk about slot forks. &gt;&gt; I love slot forks. &gt;&gt; What happened with you and Vercel? Let's let's get in this right get right into it. I don't know if you want to maybe &gt;&gt; what? I'm happy to talk about it. Okay, like, I'm happy to like talk about it because &gt;&gt; Some people, you know, they're not always on Twitter, so maybe they missed it. But, I think it's an important event. &gt;&gt; Sure.

&gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I know, it does it does Well, in my life, sure, but like, about the importance of software. Okay, so, for context, okay? &gt;&gt; For context, uh I've been in this industry long enough that I have friends everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; Competitors, not competitors, previous jobs, future jobs. We describe the industry as a forest of revolving doors. Uh it's why you maintain like, just candor and being friendly with everyone.

In fact, uh we love Vercel's AI SDK. A whole portion of my agency's SDK is built on top of them. We feel like we've built the best back end for them. And we have personal relationship with them. Like, I'll be hanging be grabbing a beer with Nico uh at some point today. But, there is this tension. Twitter amplifies like, drama, and particularly like, management, and you know what? I kind of stay away from that.

There's a little bit of tension amongst competitors, especially because the medium encourages that kind of thing. Okay. The event is I was at JSConf. I was hanging out with Harvi from Vercel, and I love him. 10 on 10 human being. What a wonderful time I had there. I loved Spain. Uh and I was playing with this project that Vercel Labs had just come out with called just bash. I loved it. What do you What a great idea. Pure Pure implementation of bash in JavaScript.

And I was like, oh, of course I want to make some of this stuff work with Cloudflare. And the way I did it in 2026 is I just point Opus at it and I go out like for lunch, etc. Right? Like I come back and it's spat out 5,000 lines of code. I'm like, yeah, okay, fine. Like I'll just like publish it. And my entire plan there was I would because I look up to I won't name names here. But because I look up to these people, I was like, I'm going to have a great time in Spain.

I'm going to go back home, polish this, and on Monday, like I'll send a PR. We'll have a issue description. Which is how I interact with every other open source repo in my entire life. I went back. I crashed. I woke up and I have uh DMs from uh Cloudflare management saying, "Have you checked Twitter?" &gt;&gt; I go on Twitter and the Vercel CTO is uh trashing my work saying, "Welcome &gt;&gt; It's like it's like, you know, one guy, you know, side projects.

And and and suddenly it's Cloudflare did this. &gt;&gt; I'm Exactly. It's Cloudflare did this. &gt;&gt; I was like, dude, I saw my career like fall apart with that message. No, but that's just it. Like that was my immediate reaction to seeing the CTO of a $10 billion company. I was like, I I didn't think I would get fired, but I was just like, well, this is not it at all. So, I responded in the most earnest way. I was like, bro, I wanted to talk to you. I came back and napped.

Like I You know what's funny? The talk I gave at JSConf España is now online where I talk so warmly about Vercel and Just Bash and their sandbox project. This was the context it was happening in. Uh anyway, so I wake up to this and I responded. I'm like, I'm sorry. That's how I I did it. And then something strange happened which is like half the internet decided to like stand up for me. And they were like, "Sunil's the nicest guy.

Why did you have to do this?" I spent the next 24 hours just a wash in this love. Yeah, let's talk about slow up forks for a while, right? &gt;&gt; I think we also have to mention the most recent, right? There was a leak of some repo or some hot code leak. And what did we do? We Someone Someone forked it and then rewrote it in Python. &gt;&gt; to to avoid the Python license. &gt;&gt; Of like the repo itself. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; People tagged me in those threads.

They're like, is this you? I'm like, no, it's not me. &gt;&gt; And people love that version, right? &gt;&gt; it's weird because of the environment. Forking is a great sign of prestige respect in my culture. You're in my culture. It's how the React community grew. It's like it's one button and it's like how you should like no one makes money off of it. &gt;&gt; of what open source is, right? You want to build on it, you should take our work, fork it, and do whatever.

And why not port it to a different language? &gt;&gt; Like I encourage like every time someone talks to me about the Agents SDK there and they tell me, "Oh, it's kind of Uh we think we can build something better." I'm like, "Bro, go for it. Like everyone wins if you do this. I don't make less money if I'm successful or not successful.

Like I mean like if you're in it for the love of the game, then do it for the love of the game." &gt;&gt; Actually, that was quite hilarious because they thought that they could get away by rewriting Cloud Code in Python. But I think some lawyers saw it and they're like, "Nope, this is a derivative work.

Like it actually breaks copyright." &gt;&gt; You know, one thing I've been thinking about slow forks is that actually you maybe want to encourage more slow forks because then you own the dependency. Right? So then you don't have the like LM issue, you don't have the Axios issue. You can just vendor Axios but in your own slow fork of Axios. And then now you own it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, no, [laughter] 100%.

Like it's bro, it's how the like before NPM, before whatever like software used to be distributed on Usenet on email. And then you take it, you change it, you share something. And now the cycles have become shorter, but I forking is so fundamental to how we build software. &gt;&gt; It's interesting. It's very non-agentic, right? Like there's a lot of will I use a microservice or will I just vibe code a little you know, a replica for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, build versus buy has really changed.

&gt;&gt; Build versus buy, but then there's no fork in that, right? There's no go see prior work, fork it, and adapt it, simplify it, whatever. We We don't see that type of a pattern, right? We just see rebuild it, use it, but people don't fork. &gt;&gt; I think there's also this tendency now, which is open source repos have become adversarial grounds. So, on the agent's SDK, for example, we had to shut down contributions. We only allow issues right now.

&gt;&gt; And like we are we are like we can have the longest description there because the end result is I'm going to take a resolution and paste it into Opus. Now, whether you're burning your tokens or my tokens, well, I prefer my tokens because I'm great at asking questions. Uh and uh I do like taking credit for the clanker work. I think open source repos have become adversarial to the point that people are almost afraid of gaining um popularity in that space.

I've spoken to at least like four or five open source maintainers here, and they are like, "Yeah, it's it's really bad out there right now." Yeah, the worst ones are the fake security reports. Yeah, they look extremely valid, and you look at it, and it just doesn't make sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we had that uh uh talk in the morning with uh Peter from Open Claw. Uh it is the number one source of attacks right now. You compromise Open Claw, you get access to everyone.

Uh for for a remote code that's called it. &gt;&gt; Any other CTAs uh just in general, you know, we we were we do have to wrap up, but I always appreciate you uh coming by and dropping your wisdom. &gt;&gt; Alpha thought leading is is is the the term that always comes to mind. &gt;&gt; Alpha thought leading. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, in 20 18 was the React Rally where you were presenting your your VR testing. &gt;&gt; That's right.

&gt;&gt; And you were like, "I'm first going to do some alpha thought leading." And ever since then I was I was I've been trying to do alpha thought leading as well. &gt;&gt; You are one of the best at the game I think [laughter] like Look. &gt;&gt; This is alpha tall eating actually. &gt;&gt; The real the real thing I encourage people to do is to be original. Okay? In such a crazy world where any idea seems to work now, like the client will like will make it work for you.

Don't even try to do something incrementally better. &gt;&gt; Build sci-fi stuff. &gt;&gt; Build stuff like for your family. Use agents SDK for doing it. Don't build it like because you think you're going to get like a big enterprise deal. You own so much agency in changing the world and I want people to just be original. I want them to try the wild stuff for which infrastructure and LLMs almost fail you at this moment.

Like how do we get to the next step change? Uh I This is my only thing I desire of people. Like just just I I'm begging you to be original and to have courage to try a new idea. I don't need another agent framework. Nobody needs it. You should use agents SDK. &gt;&gt; Yeah, except yours. Except yours. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'm really looking forward to your talk. Thank you for dropping by and thank you for sharing. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll be talking about it in a couple of hours. It's pretty great. &gt;&gt; You can find the recording somewhere. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. &gt;&gt; Oh.
