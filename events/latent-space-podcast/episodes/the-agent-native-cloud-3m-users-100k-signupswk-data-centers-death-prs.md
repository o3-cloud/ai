## Summary

This episode by Jake Cooper covers If you are writing code by hand, you are doing this wrong, right? Um but then like who who reviews things for like CVE and like all those other things you can &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like we just you're just going to become them over time, right?" And so you have to have a core thesis about like why does this business need to go and exist at this point in time.

## Key Points

1. If you are writing code by hand, you are doing this wrong, right?
2. And so, we want to reach as many people as possible.
3. Um and they were like, "Yeah, you roughly know what you're doing in building a product.
4. Because that's like the the holy grail of of loops, right?
5. &gt;&gt; You should have a free tier like the model providers give you free tokens if you let them use the data.
6. I mean it's just like and it's crazy because like some of my first deployment experiences were like on Heroku like it's like a foundational thing where &gt;&gt; I had a freaking alias in my bash for like Heroku deployments.
7. &gt;&gt; I think for for most companies it's actually bound by deployment at this point in time.
8. So long as you have a cloning machine for your pets.

## Transcript

If you are writing code by hand, you are doing this wrong, right? Like your code, the tools are good enough at this point like that you can move extremely extremely quickly and like yes, there are issues and pain points and all these other things. Um, but you should be reviewing the code that you are writing instead of trying to go and write it by hand.

Like all of those architectural patterns, all of those other things like you're not just don't like you're not going to throw them in the garbage or whatever. Actually, they matter more now than than than any other time. But you just shouldn't spend your time generating code that you would write. Like if you know how to go in and write it, just like ask the agent to go in and write it and then reconcile it until it looks like you would have written it.

&gt;&gt; Before we get into today's episode, I just have a small message for listeners. Thank you. We would not be able to bring you the AI engineering, science, and entertainment content that you so clearly want if you didn't choose to also click in and tune into our content. We've been approached by sponsors on an almost daily basis. But fortunately, enough of you actually subscribe to us to keep all this sustainable without ads, and we want to keep it that way.

But I just have one favor to ask all of you. The single most powerful, completely free thing you can do is to click that subscribe button. It's the only thing I'll ever ask of you. And it means absolutely everything to me and my team that works so hard to bring the Inspace to you each and every week. If you do it, I promise you we'll never stop working to make the show even better. Now, let's get into it. Hey everyone, welcome to the latest space podcast.

This is Allesio, founder of Colonel Labs, and I'm joined by Swixs, editor of Len Space. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. And today we're in the studio with Jay Cooper of Railway, &gt;&gt; conductor of railway. &gt;&gt; Conductor at railway. Yeah. Choo choo. &gt;&gt; Have that like anywhere on like your &gt;&gt; Well, we like we roughly call like people in Well, I don't have a business card. Um we're not we're not that big yet. Um at some point I will.

I got handed a nice business card from the super micro folks and I was like, damn, that's actually like this is pretty official. Um &gt;&gt; business cards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they're they're cool. Um they're hip. They're jiggy. Um but yeah, the the whole conductor thing, like we call some of our volunteer moderators conductors, you know. Yeah. So, it's a good one. It's a good one. Like, we're trying to figure out what we want to call each other internally.

And there's like varying levels of um thought. Some people are like, "Oh, it's super cringe." Like, just don't like you don't need a name for like, you know, people internally and some people like, "Oh yeah, we want to call each other like this thing or whatever." I was like, "We still don't have a really good one." You know, we've got like we've got like new rail recruits, we've got like trineiacs, we've got like nothing's like really &gt;&gt; train.

Um okay so well for those who don't know what is railway let's give people a crisp definition up front. Yeah, railway is the easiest way to ship anything. You just go to the canvas or you talk with claude um and you say deploy Postgress instance, deploy my GitHub repository, run this code, etc., right? Um and you'll just be up and away to the races, right? Um &gt;&gt; yeah, you have a nice animation on the landing page. &gt;&gt; Oh well, thank you. Um none of my work by the way.

They don't let me touch any of the design stuff anymore. But yeah, we want to make it really easy for not just to like deploy things, but for you to almost like evolve applications over time.

Like we believe that most of the tooling right now is kind of like stacked up like you're stacking entropy on top of entropy on top of entropy, right? So you have like Docker and Cube and then like Ansible scripts and all of these other things, right? Um, and if we can kind of like version all of your software for you and keep track of all of the changes, then we can make it actually trivial for you to clone environments, you know, fork into a parallel universe, get copies of like production da

ta, get copies of like any of your services, make those changes, validate those changes, collapse it in, uh, without kind of having to just like reproduce everything across a, you know, a staging environment or all of those other things, right? So, &gt;&gt; yeah. Amazing. Uh, one thing I I was looking at your background, right? like um Bloomberg, Uber, there's nothing immediately that stands out to me as like okay this guy's going to found like the next great platform as a service.

Uh what prepared you for real? It's almost like a curiosity just like ever go deeper, right? Um and so like you know started out on like front end stuff you know like working on the like wolf from like web mathematic and like porting it over there and then you know briefly moving to Bloomberg um and then moving towards Uber and like distributed systems and kind of like taking all the jump bikes uh kind of systems and and moving them over to a distributed uh system built on top of uh Cadence lik

e uh the yeah the pre-temporal temporal &gt;&gt; by the way I'm happy to talk about pros and cons. Yeah, I think like it's like let's do the the railway story.

&gt;&gt; And so like it's just been a a a continual step of like I I want this experience whether it is like walking up to like a bike and just unlocking it and like having it be like frictionless to like work or whatever and then like necessitating the like depth required to go in and make that happen, right? Like it it a lot of the work that that I do and a lot of the team does is like it's all in service of that experience, right? and like we fundamentally don't care like how deep we have to

go whatever like we will swim to the bottom of the swimming pool to go and get the experience right um and I think that's what a lot of of you know kind of the trajectory was right and so it's not like I have a physics PhD or whatever I did like an EECS degree you know it it's just it's always been about just trying to figure out that next step of like how do we get there right um and that's like what's led to you know starting railway for that experience and then like moving all the way to bar

e metal data centers right like you know I was adding patches to the kernel this week Right. Just to like get the experience there cuz I'm like I see it and like how much better it can be. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Patches to the L kernel this week. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, not upstream our our &gt;&gt; rail pack. No, this is different. This the OS on top of real pack. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

No, this is like this is actual kernel like but it's it's always literally just &gt;&gt; what do we have to do to get that experience and just like figure it out, right? Like anything is figure outable, right? Like you'll just you'll just figure it out, you know? Um so &gt;&gt; would you send the patch upstream or is it just because like it doesn't fit with the It's like we have to we have to work out the experience for us in general.

It has to do a lot with um the like storage layer that we're building um for some of the agentic stuff. Um so maybe it'll be useful to to people upstream, but it's it's deeply useful for for us internally. &gt;&gt; I mean you mentioned open source before so I'm just kind of curious about um how you think about starting from open source and then coding agents let you do a lot more from forks of it.

I think the it's funny because like I think GitHub's original sin is that it's like almost a series of broken pointers.

Um it's like you have essentially this thing and then you clone it and then okay great like I've just lost that whole upstream, right? How do we make it trivial for people to modify really really small pieces of it, right? And you like you think of of git almost in this like discreet sense of like I've either made a change and I've merged upstream or or I haven't, right? Um what would it look like if it was like percentage based or a little bit more non-deterministic or anything else like that?

more of like a stream of changes that you kind of like traversed as a user more as kind of like a a percentage of this is rolled out in general and it's been rolled all the way up, right? Um, you know, we have the open source like kickback program um and allowing you to deploy those templates because we almost want to make it trivial for people to like go and version these shards over time.

It solves like a really really large problem in terms of authentication, authorization, security like you know npm has that thing where you can uh almost define hey don't take any new packages or whatever like &gt;&gt; the ideal end state is actually like you should roll out progressively to the users who have the minimum impact zone for any of these things and just continually roll up right like JP Morgan or something else like that should probably be the last one on the patch line uh for that

right for all of our sakes right like because we have all of our you know money all all of those things.

It's okay if like Johnny Vibe coder gets like a broken patch or something else like that because ultimately there's so much entropy in the system that you do have to you do have to roll like rubber has to meet road at some point like you have to test at at varying levels right so yeah a little diversion from wherever we started but you know &gt;&gt; so I just wanted to like pull up this glorious chart you say uh which is basically your usage or number of &gt;&gt; uh daily signups I think &gt;&g

t; daily signups Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, so you started 6 years ago &gt;&gt; and yeah, &gt;&gt; like a slow grind. &gt;&gt; Slow grind &gt;&gt; and now now obviously you're on a rocket ship. Uh, you say don't doubt your vibe and don't quit. But like maybe if you want to pick out like certain points that were like sort of key inflections of the company that that might be fun. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, I mean at the start it's basically like how do you get your first 100 users? Like hell or high water, right? Um, and so like starting in uh, you know, we had a website and we had a support link and the support link was the Discord channel and you just showed up there and I had notifications on. I had two monitors.

I had the monitor I was working on and then I had the other monitor and if anybody came in I was like, "Oh, hey, how's it going?" Like, you know, it's like and it was like super rare or whatever. So trying to get those initial like first 100 users to like actually kind of come back to it. Um, and that's I think where you can kind of like see the really like in between January 2021 and 2022 like probably the middle like there kind of right and that's like the the start.

Um, and then you ultimately end up building a consultancy factory of like users wanted all of these things in in general. And so you kind of have to uh go back to the board a little bit and be like well what is the actual product offering that I want to build on top of these? And I think like incidentally it's funny like I think VCs really want like charts that like always look like this or whatever, right? Um, but I think in reality you actually don't want charts that look like that.

Most companies I think or at least for us there's been periods of like expansion of like okay we're going to go and add these features to like go in and test these use cases and then there's been periods of like compaction where we're saying like okay how do we have if the experience we have is really really good how do we make it significantly better right like maybe we're even stripping out features that don't like fit our ICP anymore like how do we go in and do that and I think throughout th

is whole chart you can see a lot of those things like the the boom in the like 2022 to 2023 is like we had a free tier and like everybody under the sun was like using it and and all those other things.

&gt;&gt; A lot of Reddit bots and stuff and bots &gt;&gt; and and and like I think there's a there's a thing that's really really tough to like teach people or tell people about is like when you build an open product on the internet where anybody can sign up, the internet is a horrible place that has like so many things like &gt;&gt; I told you about my PC. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Like crypto miners, you got like all these other things, right? And so you kind of go through these periods of like well how do I reach as many people as possible and then like how do I fit in exactly the use case for the people who are really really going to matter and and going to be really really excited about specifically this thing right and we go back and forth internally and then there's like a what is that a 2-year period of like making the actual business work in general right so like

free tier era &gt;&gt; losing what I think a half a million dollars a month and like you know we're making &gt;&gt; on like a 20 million bank account. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Like a 20 million bank account with like I don't know like maybe $50,000 a month in revenue or something. I was like that is horrible business.

I don't know why anybody um but anyways you have to kind of go through and and be like cool like we have an experience that people love in general but like the business has to work right.

And I think there's there's like I guess two schools of thoughts is you can you can continually run the horrible business all the way up uh in general and and have bad margins um or you can actually go go back and kind of make it work, right? And for us, you know, we've always really wanted to have like a super lean team, right? So, we're 35 people right now. You know, it's very very small. We have like what 3 million &gt;&gt; 2 million. Yeah. Yeah.

Cuz we're adding like 100,000 users a week uh right now, right? So, it's like it's growing really fast, right? But we've always wanted to have a really really lean team. Like we don't want to just like add headcount for the sake of headcount. Uh just like throw bodies at these problems.

We want to build like systems, right? It's really really hard to build systems when you're you're kind of in that expansion phase because you're just adding stuff to the to the system in general because people are asking for it or things are breaking in general, right? We basically were like, "All right, like you know, we're going to we're going to cut it for now." Like we're just we can't support this like these free users that like we want like we want to reach as many people as possible beca

use we believe that, you know, software is this really really important thing where if you can kind of like create something, it's become really difficult to create things in a physical world. So, it's really important to make it really easy for people to build things in a virtual world so that people have access to creation, right? And so, we want to reach as many people as possible. Um, but there's kind of like legs on that journey.

So, we basically had to kind of close off the the free kind of users for a little while, rebuild the business, make sure that it worked in general, right? And then I think you can kind of like see the building of that in general, right? And then I think you you see kind of some divots in those charts, right? Like if you actually follow between I think 2025 and 2026, it's either summer or winter.

That's basically it, right? like either people go on holidays with their family or they uh go on holiday. &gt;&gt; Oh, it affects that much. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

Well, because it's like it's kind of B to it's kind of B2B in general, right? And so you have a lot of these users where like they're shipping constantly and then you know they'll kind of like stop or whatever, right? And so maybe for summer or like maybe like our our activation curve is like now we see a lot of people like activating in the weekday, right? Uh because we have a lot more like business users in general.

So that gets a lot less um sheer so to speak, right? And it kind of like smooths out over time, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is there any point at which you started prioritizing um AI developments or agent development? &gt;&gt; I think like we've so we've prioritized almost like Agentic as like a um top offunnel thing. Um and probably over the last like six months we've probably deep deeply prioritized like Agentic as a as a mechanism to go and build and and deploy things.

uh just because we we believe fundamentally like the the curve is so sheer and like that is the way that people are going to go and build and deploy software. Um and it it almost like fundamentally doesn't matter if it's if like this is.com or not because we're all on the internet now anyways, right? Um and so if agents are going to go and deploy a bunch of things and we hit an inference wall at some point, then like at some point we will go in and fix those problems.

But like that will be kind of the dominant species over the next like 10 years is is we've moved from assembly to C to C++ to JavaScript to now like words, right? And you're going to need to be able to close that loop, right? Um but that's that's where it goes, you know? So &gt;&gt; when you say this is.com, do you mean like buying the domain or &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.

Uh I I mean like actually just like you know they had a bunch of runup in the dot era for companies because they were like the internet is really really important and then you hit kind of like bottlenecks fundamental laws of physics math didn't work all those other things and and everybody kind of like you know went back down to the earth right um but at the end of the day it didn't matter because the internet is like so so impactful for our lives that if you operate on a long enough time horiz

on that you should be like you should just build these things anyways because you you can see where that's going right and that's where I fundamentally believe a lot of the agent stuff is right and we can talk about a little bit of it later, but you're going to get to a point where you're running thousands of these agents like in parallel, right? Like one, what's the inference cost for that? What's the compute cost? How do you go and make that efficient? All of those other things.

But like two, how do you go and coordinate all this stuff? Like we had we have we have issues coordinating humans in in in general, right? We don't even have good tooling for that.

And now we're starting to to figure out it's like, oh, like how do you get agents to coordinate? How do you go and get them to be able to like safely version changes or or like for them to know when to like put their hand up to get somebody to intervene, right? Um otherwise it just becomes like a interrupt factory that's like crazy you &gt;&gt; Well so maybe we'll go right on the technical side of things. Yeah.

&gt;&gt; What are the core like infrastructure or architectural beliefs of real way that allow you to do what you do? &gt;&gt; Yeah I think the the primitives matter a lot for us um like a lot a lot we need to be able to do network compute and storage and orchestration all kind of around it. you kind of need control over a lot of those things.

Like we've talked a lot about like how we don't really use cube like Kubernetes because we want the higher order of control to be able to like go in and place workloads in very very specific places, right? Um the reason for that is like you know it's kind of the thing we we talked about previously about like you have to be very very efficient with these agents like memory reuse all of those other things or you're going to massively massively blow up your cost structure, right? I think also inci

dentally being able to rack and stack your own servers and and uh build your own uh metal it unlocks a level of like uh performance one but like two cost where you can say oh those experiences that you want to offer where you're running a thousand agents in parallel are not like massively cost prohibitive right cuz like if you look at just like token use right now or compute use or anything else like that those things are blowing up massively right over time those things are going to have to get

a lot and a lot more efficient you can get a lot of almost like back of the napkin balance sheet margin, whatever you want to call it, to to kind of make those experiences like solid by building your own metal, right? And so, kind of to the earlier point of like we've always tried to go a little bit deeper every time to make that experience. It's all in the service of offering that that uh differentiated experience to as many people as like like humanly possible, you know? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

You have a data center in Singapore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we have two in every other region now. Singapore, we're adding a second one in Q3. So, Yep. &gt;&gt; So, so like what's it like? I mean I I' I've never built a data center. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we'll have to like go to one or whatever. &gt;&gt; Go to like Equinox and say, "Hey, I want some." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So So yeah, I mean I can I can Equinex. Um yeah, Equinox. I mean Equinex.

&gt;&gt; I mean you can put a you can put a data center in the Steam room and get nice and hot or whatever. Um but yeah. Yeah. You basically just go and you say, "Hey, listen. I want uh power and I want a cage." Uh and they're like, "Great.

Here this is what it's going to be." Um and then you rent the cage for a period of time and then you have to fill the cage uh with racks servers and then hook up internet to it, right? Um that's realistically &gt;&gt; and then they handle everything else, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just handle everything else, right? Um so &gt;&gt; and like what's the math versus obviously the clouds? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Uh it our payback period when we go to to metal um if we rent it in the cloud, our payback period is about 3 months. &gt;&gt; It goes crazy. &gt;&gt; It's nuts. Yeah.

and and that's like four years worth of like depreciated hardware, right? Um and so I think it's like you're going to see a lot of this almost like compute crunch so to speak because a lot of the hyperscalers are buying up a lot of stuff like we're working directly with &gt;&gt; OEMs and retail like resellers and and like directly with people who are like building these machines like Super Micro, Dell, all those other things to go in and get these things things working.

But uh you know upstream there's like a bunch of supply stuff. you know, we it was funny cuz when we raised our last round uh in between basically deploying the capital for the servers and um actually I think even even now the amount of money that we've raised uh is less than the amount of money that we have in the bank plus how what the value of the servers are because the servers have actually appreciated in value because RAM has gone up in in general, right? Um so it's kind of nuts just in t

erms of like how valuable hardware and all of this stuff is, right? If you look at especially a lot of the like hypers scalers like what they deployed like $80 billion of like capital expenditures like this year and and like into next it's going to be like more in general right there's these massive massive scale like infrastructure bill does and you can look at that by like wow that's crazy that they're spending like way more than the Manhattan project but like again if you go back to every per

son is going to run you know dozens hundreds whatever of agents in parallel like &gt;&gt; you should spend more than you have you have like you have no conceptual idea of like how much compute is required to go in and make that experience happen. Even if you're deeply efficient, even if you're sharing resources, even if you're doing all of these things correctly, and that doesn't even count inference.

&gt;&gt; How do you plan out the buildout? Like I mean the growth chart is so vertical that like you know like uh are you usually 100% utilization rate as soon as you're live with these tracks or like how far ahead are you? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So, so um like we still maintain like cloud presence for like bursting essentially and so what we can do is um you know we work with AWS and GCP and a few of those you know other clouds like we can just rent and then the moment we kind of get space or power or whatever you almost just like compact those off the cloud right like we cuz we started on on the clouds and then we built a system to allow us to migrate to our own metal and so there's nothing that says you can't just continually do that

again which is exactly what we do right now right and So we we never want to be in a spot where essentially we are um you know compute constrained right um and at the start of the year like we actually got to a point where we were computed because uh the one upstream provider that we were actually working with wasn't able to give us quota at the rate that we needed to and the hardware was like slower right and so we had to do a bunch of different stuff I spent a weekend rebuilding our entire li

ke network like &gt;&gt; overlay essentially so that we could straddle uh five different clouds &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; yeah Oracle, AWS, ourselves, GCP and and like one other one, right? And we can do more than that now, right? But, you know, we got into a spot where like we were just trying to like pack instances tight cuz we couldn't get the amount of compute that we needed, right? Um, and it was really unfortunate because as a result like some of we had a few like reliability kind of things

which are now kind of past us. But it was all a result of this kind of like there was a tweet that I made where like you know I I like got in trouble because I was trying to point it out but I accidentally caught the Superbase folks in the crossfire.

Like the tweet was about there's it's really really difficult and it's going to become more and more difficult to acquire compute at the rate that these models need to acquire compute right um and we got bit by it which is you know fair and reasonable in the karma scheme of of me you know trying to point it out um so yeah &gt;&gt; how do you think about pricing knowing that you might not have your own metal available at all time like are you pricing assuming that you'll need to like pay yoursel

f extra margins if you had to end up going in the cloud &gt;&gt; because we've built out our our metal data centers like our margins on metal are like quite high for the like 70%. Um, and so we can actually deeply subsidize the the cloud business if we want to scale at a reasonable rate. And so we have a few different like it's actually very fun from like an operations perspective because you have a few different levers on how you can go and scale it.

You have like the metal which actually like makes your margins. You have the cloud burst etc. You have debt you can use to like buy servers in general. So it's a very interesting like operational like problem to basically say like okay we have this much cash. Oh and then you have obviously venture capital that you can raise on top of it right. Um so you have this much cash how much money should we raise? how like how quickly can we go and deploy it etc.

we can scale revenue as basically as quickly as we can scale compute provided we continue to make it trivially easy for people to go and build and deploy and that like the faster you can close this loop and and the more operational excellent you are with the capital like just the faster your business can it's it's just a basically like straight linear kind of like yeah deployment rate on some of that stuff yeah &gt;&gt; I think infra startups raising debt is a tool that people don't utilize eno

ugh or know enough about what what can you tell us about that &gt;&gt; yeah I mean is it secured against your G your CPUs or what? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just it's just secured against against our uh like hardware, right? Um and &gt;&gt; what what rates do you get? Like who? &gt;&gt; We just pay like prime at whatever it is plus like we we can refinance any of the debt as it goes down. Um like the terms are pretty good from that perspective.

I think like &gt;&gt; the the unfortunate thing is like Twitter has no nuance or whatever. So they're like venture debt bad or whatever. It's like well no like as with all things like &gt;&gt; it's not venture debt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Or data center debt. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

It's data center debt, right? Like, yeah, I think there's there's specific tools in specific areas where you can be very very deliberate about not just using one specific tool as a hammer, like venture capital as a hammer for everything. Um, you just have to kind of like go out and explore it and figure out how it kind of like &gt;&gt; VC is the most expensive financing you can get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

I I think incidentally, I think also people think about VC completely wrong from a raising capital perspective. &gt;&gt; Okay. Tell us how VC is wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

Well, I I think most people are like, "Okay, how do I raise as much money as possible from like whoever is like probably the best that I can get at that point in time?" And I think that's like kind of close to right, but I think what you should be doing, or at least what we've tried to go in and do, is like try and figure out what almost unfair advantage you can buy with that equity because it's the cheapest equity you're or it's the most expensive kind of equity you're going to give away at th

at point in time, assuming your company's going to get better and better and better. And how do you use that to like go in and work with somebody who is stellar and who's going to go in and compliment you, right? Like, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like serious &gt;&gt; lucky. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like, you know, great. I've never started a company. Race race Milwaukee. He's got good advice. I can text him all the time. He's really fast, etc. Like, awesome. Right.

Then you kind of like move on and and you kind of like, you know, worked with uh you know, John and Jordan at Unusual, right? Um and they were like, "Yeah, you roughly know what you're doing in building a product. Like, we're just going to mostly like leave you alone and be totally available for advice." &gt;&gt; Amazing. Awesome. Get to series A.

Business is a total, you know, operational tire, right? because we just don't know how to scale a business, right? Go and work with Erica and you know Jordan's over at at Redpoint.

bonus like you know we get to work with them continually right and then now moving into like you know raised from uh TQ and FPV like we're moving into the enterprises now right and like feeding into there right so every step of the way we've kind of moved towards like who can we partner at this specific time who's going to help us unlock that next section of the journey because guess what I just I don't know enterprise sales I can roughly like eyeball it and be like yeah as an engineer I think

these are the kind of features that we're going to roughly going to need and we have some wonderful people who are going to help us internally but you really want to work with those people like at the boardroom dynamic level are going to be like, "Oh, yeah, we're all aligned and that's obviously what we want to go in and do and we can spend our time basically saying, "How do we how do we win this?" versus like bickering about strategy, right? &gt;&gt; Uh, no.

I just had to pull up some beautiful data center charts. &gt;&gt; Uh, I feel like you've done others. I couldn't I just couldn't find them. &gt;&gt; Well, these are good. I mean, like they all kind of look the same. Like the servers in a rack. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. This is our box. It's like, do you want to see more racks? It's like, oh, yeah. It's like, you know, &gt;&gt; the J Cooper signature edition. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

It's a &gt;&gt; we have we we actually have uh we have plans uh internally. Uh yeah, so it'll be fun. Uh we've got a few different promos that we're going to do uh and like stunts for for the year. Uh so those will be fun. &gt;&gt; You had a tweet about data centers in space just before we wrapped this section. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why no data centers in space? Why you hate why you hate so much? &gt;&gt; Okay.

So So it's not no data centers in space because actually I think like my hot take is like I think this is solvable. I've just never seen anybody solve it, right? Uh because you need to &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Well, you you didn't you said you said how you how you going to dissipate that much heat in a vacuum? You're making a physics claim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, because because I haven't seen anybody like prove how you're going to go and dissipate that much heat in a vacuum, right? Like it it doesn't mean that it's not possible. It just means that like nobody's kind of put it up. &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; Astrophage. &gt;&gt; The Martian thing. Okay. You're very loy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.

But yeah, I don't I mean it could work in general, right? But I think a lot of people and I I think incidentally this is probably what you have to sort of do um is like they're putting almost the cart before the horse is like oh yeah we're going to put data centers in space.

It's like okay but how it's like well we have some period of time to basically figure it out right it's like it's like you know in the Martian where they're like oh how are we going to like intercept with &gt;&gt; oh okay right um it's like how are we going to do that? It's like well we'll figure it out.

have so however long to go in and figure that out you know so &gt;&gt; yeah yeah yeah making making a bet on like human invention is weird because you just have to blind trust that it's can be solved but &gt;&gt; 100% right &gt;&gt; I feel like physics and there's like some first principles bounds that you can put on like maybe not &gt;&gt; yeah I know right &gt;&gt; like maybe you're asking to travel time here or like break some fundamental thermodynamic law &gt;&gt; yeah and I don't know how

VCs do this like incidentally too because it's like how do you know what's like basically not possible and like is a grift versus like uh is possible but like sounds completely insane, right? And you're like, "Oh, cool." Like, you know, we're going to put data centers in space. It's like, &gt;&gt; okay, coin flip as to whether that's like one or the other. You just don't know, I guess. And I guess you'll know in like 10 years. &gt;&gt; Cool. That's one cycle. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So, moving back to agents. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think the branching that you do, the the fast spin up and orchestration, it's kind of like the pre-work that like happened to be exactly what agents want. &gt;&gt; What do agents want differently than humans? humans? I think they want the ability to uh version thing.

So it's it's not like actually that different like there's just almost like slight deviations in terms of how it kind of materializes, right? So agents want a way to be able to go in and and test changes incrementally, right? Like we we have feature flags as like engineers or whatever, right? Like is there any reason why they can't just use feature flags, right? I don't think so. Like I think there's ways that you can just go in and do that, right? They want version control.

Is there ways we can use git or not git? I think that one is like realistically completely up in the air, right? And I do think that's something ultimately outside git will emerge uh in terms of how we're going to go and version a lot of these things over time. They need observability. You need to be able to go in and essentially query what happened at what point in time, which steps failed, uh traces, logs, uh metrics, all of those other things. They need like network comput and storage.

They need the ability to write files, save files, iterate on files, snapshots, file system, all of those other things, right? And so I think a lot of the stuff that we roughly needed is like very very kind of in line with a lot of the stuff that that agents also need, right? Um, and so like the branching and forking stuff like it's not different. Like we're just moving a thousand times quicker than than we used to.

And so some of these things like look like you really need like something massively massively different, but it's just you need something massively better than what currently existed, right? You need orchestration, you need something massively better than cube, right? You need like networking, you need something probably better than envoy, right? Like and it just goes all the way down the stack essentially in terms of well if the the workload profile doesn't change so much as it gets like massi

vely massively compressed because you need to do thousands of these things. What assumptions change right like CD is going to melt, right? Like you know you need to replace it with something, right? And then I think you can go all the way down the stack and basically say okay well that part has to change and that part has to change and that part has to change.

And the interesting thing about the kind of like super exponential curve is that you have to build your systems in such a way where you can rip out those parts at any point in time because a new bottleneck might emerge because you know you start getting really really good at like parallel agents right um and then that's that's kind of where the new bottleneck is right and and that breaks a different part of your system right um so I think it's very much like similar kind of stuff that that kind

of like like humans have needed you just need at a thousandx scale right so like how do you how do you do code review &gt;&gt; in the age of the agents Right. I guess is is more of a question. &gt;&gt; More agents who don't. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Um but then like who who reviews things for like CVE and like all those other things you can &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Okay.

And and then that's how we we hit the inference wall at some point, right? Um and you can continually throw agents and agents and agents at that problem, right? But like, you know, I think there's I think there's a limit to like the amount of of agents you can kind of throw at a problem. You started though, you already had a CLI before it was cool, I guess. How is &gt;&gt; CLI have always been cool by the way.

Um, but yeah, &gt;&gt; how is the shape of like what you're exposing changed if at all? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So, so I think um the CLI changes because the way that we think about this is like how do you give Claude or Codeex or Chat or like whatever like any of these models almost like a handhold &gt;&gt; and like a CLI is a single command when you think about it, right? It's like, okay, well, you're going to do a deploy or whatever, right? Um, you're going to get logs, you know, whatever, right? Like things that were prohibitively annoying to humans are not actually prohibitively annoying to agents.

They're really, really nice, right? And so if if I wanted to hand you a CLI and I said, "Hey, guess what? The CLI has 40 arguments and 600 flags." You'd be like, "Wow, that's crazy. Like, I'm never going to use all those things in general, right?" But if you hand it to an agent and you say, "Hey, that's 40 arguments and 600 flags." Like, oh yeah, this is excellent.

You know, like I I have so many handles that I can go in and kind of like work on with this, right? And so I think incidentally if you're going to go in and try and expose things for agents over over that mechanism, you want to just basically have as many handles as possible where they can get information query additional dynamic information and then see how it can close that loop like as quickly as possible.

Most of the kind of like problems right now are actually just how do you close loop as as quickly as possible. Where does the agent get stuck and and how can you go and kind of remove that? That's why incidentally like telemetry is very very important because if you can tell where the agent gets stuck from the CLI and you say hey listen like 12% of people are actually getting uh deviated from the happy path because of this thing and now I go and add this arg and that drives it down to 2%.

you've massively increased the like rate of the the loop closing for for a lot of people in general, right? So that's kind of the way that we think about not just the CLI but every point in in the dashboard, right? Like it is a user journey from I hear about railway, &gt;&gt; I go and get something deployed. I get my first green build whatever aha moment. I see an endpoint. I see some logs. I see whatever.

And then I go in and iterate, right? And then I go in an iterate loop is indefinite and infinite until the end of time, right? It's basic like user wants to deploy new thing, user wants to deploy deploy new postgress instance, user wants to change their their their code, user wants to iterate all all over time, right? And so if you just focus on a lot of those iteration loops and and figuring out what's blocking that loop from closing as quickly as possible, like one of the things we talk about

internally is you never ever ever want to be waiting on compute anymore. You always want to be waiting on intelligence, right? And if you're waiting on compute, there's a bottleneck that needs to be destroyed there because at some point that bottleneck will be so so so large that some other workflow will kind of emerge to go in and and change a lot of that stuff.

And I I think incidentally like you know we've built a really really awesome product where you can push code and then you build the code and all those other things, right? But that like push pull whatever kind of like loop I just fundamentally believe it's going to go away, right? Like it's we're going to get to a point where you make a small change in production that change is versioned across your entire kind of infrastructure.

you're working alongside, you know, copy and write versions of your your database, all of your infrastructure and then you merge it in and instantaneously it's it's like live, right? Because that's like the the holy grail of of loops, right? Um but that like pushpull rebuild thing, right, is a point of friction that we are like removing entirely from from our loops. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's incredibly fast. So if anyone hasn't tried it, like &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh that that fast feedback is great.

You know my hot take is that you know railway was kind of famous for its canvas which sort of visualizes your infrastructure unless you manipulate it visually but that was for humans. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And actually now for the next phase in growth like really CLI is more important than canvas which is what you were famous for. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So, I think the the canvas is funny because like it's actually just a mechanism to to show you changes over time, but I think you're totally right in the sense that like we have previously used it a lot as an input and its goal moving forward is actually a lot more like an output.

Um, what I mean by that is you would go to the canvas and you make some changes and all these other things, whatever, right? Um, and you'd see them and you know your agents or or your your infrastructure would evolve over time, right? Now you just have a bunch of agents that like they have access to the CLI and they can go and make those changes in general, right? And so the canvas actually instead of becoming this like input thing where you're like, "Oh, cool.

Like how do I go in and make this happen?" It's actually just more of an output thing. It it basically says, "What information?" &gt;&gt; Yeah.

What information does the human need at this point in time to make uh suitable decisions about about uh um like control requests of do I approve this, do I not approve this, right? Like &gt;&gt; that's realistically all the canvas becomes at that point in general, right? And also a way and I think this is important and I think this is um lost on a lot of people who are like building some of these like canvas experiences. It has to be almost like an anchor for your context.

It has to be like a port in the storm. It has to be like you have to think basically about it as like layers and like a file system almost to like get to the next spot, right? And so you have all your infrastructure and like this is why the canvas starts is like it's just a project, right? And then you you have a drill down chart, right? like it's like I'm breaking down into these services or this like section that just is like a function or code or anything else like that because you want to a

ctually be able to represent the entire thing not just in your head but in this in this canvas so that other people can also get that representation so that they can think on the same wavelength as you so that they can move as as quickly right I think a lot of orgs especially as they scale they get in trouble because all that context lives in somebody's head basically and it's like oh how does this microser work it's like I have no idea go go ask this specific person, right? And then you have en

tire categories and classes of products that are built around like how do you do context discovery at at all these things. And I think a lot of that stuff get just gets melted in terms of if you can have a really really solid hierarchy and you can infinitely nest services, infinitely less nest code, infinite less context, infinitely nest all these things all the way down. Um that's what allows you to kind of build these kind of like structures up over time, you know.

And I think it's also what's going to allow us to like build I've written about this like these like hyperructures like things that are way way bigger and like you know you look at the Golden Gate Bridge and you're like how how did we build that like you know we there's that whole meme of like oh how do we build this like we lost the technology or we don't know how anymore right it's like it's like well yeah I mean to some extent yes because a lot of the coordination that we that built those th

ings like has evolved right um and like has changed and there new things we've lost almost like some of the art of like building that structure as we've just jammed everything into Slack, right? And we're just like everything happens through Slack and it's &gt;&gt; But you don't have anything in Discord. So &gt;&gt; yeah, that's the same point. It doesn't It doesn't really matter. It's just like message passing and interrupts. Message passing and interrupts.

Message passing and interrupts, right? Like &gt;&gt; So you're arguing that there should be something better, more structured &gt;&gt; than Slack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, for sure. I think Slack I think and incidentally, I think Discord's awful, too. Um &gt;&gt; this is the equivalent of my mom test, right? Like what have you done that has your solution to this? So internally we've built a a tool called central station that allows us to go in and aggregate all the context from all of our users.

Um so every piece of feedback, every piece of customer support, every single thing like that uh gets aggregated into uh what we call like clusters. If you have an incident brewing or like anything else like that now we can go and determine how many users are affected all of those other things etc. And then we can actually break off a discussion based on that.

And I think a lot of that is actually a lot more more helpful and and more correct in terms of instead of like having just these like long running channels where you're just like which channel should I put this thing in, right? Like if you can dynamically aggregate that information and dynamically route it to the right person based on the context, right? We know we know internally like these four people are pretty close on networking, right? And so if we see like okay, we've got a networking th

ing, you can roughly like drill it down to like those four people, right? And if you're saying like, "Oh, okay, cool. It's actually with this part." You can just go and like look at the the commits, right? And this is like no longer a manual process internally.

Like this is the whole point of why we built if you go to like uh station or help.railway.com the whole reason we built this thing, right? Is because we wanted to figure out how we're going to go and scale with like a massive massive massive amount of leverage to go and aggregate all this feedback. You know, &gt;&gt; this is built inhouse. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, and then I I remember helping out on this one with Angelo &gt;&gt; uh in in 2023. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Yeah, you scale a lot with uh with a very small team. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're like 10 times bigger now. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. You have your full developer account here? &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you go to if you go to &gt;&gt; I can just like crown this and then just &gt;&gt; You don't even have to chron it. We expose this as like a pub subable thing. So, go to railway.com/stats. &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go.

Yeah, that's your &gt;&gt; So, it's like all realtime metrics for all of this stuff. There's a way to get this as like a JSON too somewhere if you care or anything else like that. &gt;&gt; Look it up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, we're we're big on like trying to build everything in in public, talk about a lot of the stuff we're working on, you know, like we've had some issues or whatever in the past and we're like, "Hey, cool.

Like here's how we're fixing these things." Like we've, you know, we've got both compliments as well as some flack for our incident reports and like always trying to like make them better over time just to like talk with people, right? So, &gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah. Um any obviously you had a big one recently. Uh I like that it was only scopes to 3000.

uh you use presumably use central station like any talk uh talking through like what happens and I guess how do you how do you address it you know internally as a team? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So internally has deemed this one like really really sucked.

you know, it was it was like to do with an upstream provider that uh didn't they didn't do the behavior that they they said they were documenting, which is unfortunate given they like wrote the RFC on how the behavior should work, but we rolled those things out and then Central Station kind of caught that initially where we had a couple users being like, oh, like the caches aren't invalidating for some of this stuff, right? Um and so turn it off immediately, etc., right? Um, but when you go and

kind of roll out to those like that like large user base of like 3 million people, right? You know, like you have a lot of different disperate behaviors that that can kind of come up, right? And so try as we will, we tested those things in, you know, staging. Uh, we have tests for them. Uh, like all this other stuff.

Um, you know, and unfortunately we like hit kind of an an edge case there, right? And we've incidentally like gone and hardened a lot of those systems and now we can like make a lot of that stuff better. But um yeah, it was it was a it was a tough one unfortunately. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I always wonder how like the private disclosures are supposed to work if people find an an issue.

Are they supposed to like contact you first? Is there like when you run a platform these things are going to happen? &gt;&gt; And what channels should people pursue to like you know quietly resolve it before it becomes like a a much bigger incident? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I I think there's like uh there's responsible disclosure. um we kind of heer on the side of like we'd rather overdisclose and know that you know that something is wrong versus almost like having your provider gaslight you.

Um and so yeah um you know we've we've we've kind of we've aired on the side of like sharing those things kind of more publicly even if they go and impact a small like subset of of those users, right? Um and that's kind of just a decision that we've made internally. It's it's under like we have four values. One of them is honor.

Um and so like what's the honorable thing to go in and do? It's like well you notify you notify people you know to the widest degree at which they may have been uh you know affected or if there was an issue or whatever and then we kind of confront that head on and be like why did that happen? What can we do better in the future? All of those things kind of like that you know so &gt;&gt; yeah not the whole user base.

&gt;&gt; No &gt;&gt; and that's because of like incremental rollouts and &gt;&gt; progressive rollouts um and and stuff like that right. Um so &gt;&gt; interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that should just be the norm at all large platforms, right? Like &gt;&gt; Oh, it totally should. And a variety and a variety of companies, it totally is, right? Like what there's a whole quote of like Meta runs like 10,000 versions of different versions of of meta in general.

And like to our earlier point about agents, right? Like they need the same thing. They need to be able to shadow traffic.

we need to build all these other I think we've built so much ceremony around like production is sacred all all of these other things that like we need to get to a point where it's just trivially easy to test different behaviors right in a safe environment cuz then you can make those mistakes in an environment that's that's like safe in in general right so you mentioned somebody brought it up do you see a world in which these things get automatically caught not necessarily by your agent but like

your customer agent you know what I mean that like the the cash invalidation thing seems like a pretty easy thing to the track if you know to look for it.

It's hard because then you almost need well for us to like determine it like we need almost um we'd have to hook in with like your observability infrastructure in general right this is like why we almost have the template loop on the platform is to be able to kind of roll those things out progressively where you say hey listen you know I can roll this out to like Johnny Vive coder initially right or I can push a shard and you can almost like uh consume that at your own leisure and be like oh ok

ay I'm going to update to this specific version right or have this kind of like roll out over a period of weeks where you're pushing a new version and then it goes to you know 0.1% of people 1% of people early like whatever and then rolls out all the way there right that's the kind of like non-deterministic version control that that we've kind of like talked about earlier so yeah 100% right and I do believe that like that's where most things should go go towards because I think ultimately most c

ompanies end up building that stage rollout system in in house right um and it's just the same thing built again and again and again at every single one of these these different companies so there's a massive opportunity You need to consolidate a lot of like developers. &gt;&gt; You should have a free tier like the model providers give you free tokens if you let them use the data.

Like we'll give you free compute if you're like the number one chart that goes out and you let us plug into your observability. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like incidentally we we do that, right? And that's why the the you know we talked about Yeah. We talked about you know the the impact of that on like 3,000 people or whatever.

We start with the the kind of lower impact people like the you know larger companies etc on the platform right like they're the last ultimately that should receive those kind of rollouts so that they have a version of the platform that's like deeply deeply stable right &gt;&gt; I have three services so I'm sure I get I get the first roll out you can nuke you can nuke my thing at any time man uh I guess my other question is like there's all these like s agent companies there's like the observabi

lity people also want to have agents that fix your upstream problems. How do you kind of you have your own agent in the canvas now that you can try with how do you kind of see that play out? &gt;&gt; It's almost like the stacking entropy thing in general, right? Like &gt;&gt; I think if you don't have the primitives to make iterating in production safe, it becomes very very difficult, right? And so if you're an observability provider and you're like, oh, here's this fix to this this error, right

? Like assume like 80% of those they're probably actually good. Like they're they're going to make they're going to make sense, etc., right? But then the last like 20% of that long tail of like kind of complex kind of issues in general ultimately rolling those changes out if you just kind of let somebody say like oh cool this looks good and just like stamps it there's an opportunity for you to have an issue or an incident or anything else like that and I think that's why it's really really impor

tant to have those kind of like forked environments in general and people have staging etc but it always end up ends up like deviating from prod right and so you need the primitives and the workflows and the experience like like built in in our mind on like as a first party thing on the platform so you can fork any point at any service at any point in time so that you can almost like &gt;&gt; you know I think I consider the canvas almost as like a little like sheet of transparency paper and the

agent is kind of like this little guy that you push up and it's like it should be able to like pop up in the canvas and it should be like oh cool like well I need to copy that service I need to copy that service so I can test these two things right that's my hypothesis as like an agent or whatever um okay cool I can go in and do that looks good for all the this stuff ideally I get a readonly copy uh of of production. Anything that's PIA, etc.

is kind of like marked um as like a transform when we when we automatically clone that database or go for a copy on write version of it or or read from it. And it just makes those changes.

It says does does this actually work, right? Like as close to production as as possible, right? Because ultimately that's how close you have to be or you just have a massive amount of drift where oh I've changed this thing and and then it just kind of gets out of sort, right? That the system gets a lot more unstable.

And and I think that that's like what you see with a lot of these kind of almost massive systems that these companies built on top of like Docker for local and then like cube for production and like this specific thing for whatever, right? It's like all of that complexity ends up getting to a point where it slows down the developers. Yes.

But it just it just gets to a point where it's so unstable at scale that it becomes hard for people to go and iterate and make those changes, right? And so we want to compress a lot of that stuff way down and just say like as like as close to prod as you could possibly be. That's where we want to be. Right. &gt;&gt; I was texting uh Erica and she for for questions and she she says actually you were originally not a believer in ASR. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah.

Uh I mean I' I've kind of &gt;&gt; Have you come around on it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I flipped. I'm actually still not a believer on the ARS because I believe that you need you need the primitives to make those things safe. And if you just unleash an AI S sur on your production infrastructure and you don't have like safe primitives for like copying volumes, making sure that this is fine, it's going to nuke your production database.

Like it's it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when it's going to nuke that database, right? I'm a big believer in in making those kind of like loops safe in general. I think I was a pretty deep like almost I don't want to say AI skeptic until like and then 2024 I kind of like was like okay like maybe I can make this thing roughly do it etc.

2025 I was like okay now I can like hold this etc and then like over the whole Christmas break I think you just saw like I guess winter break uh but you just massive like everybody come back came back like oh my god it's almost impossible to hold &gt;&gt; seriously on the cloud docs &gt;&gt; uh cloudbot well cloud &gt;&gt; but it's gotten to a point where it's it's almost like it's harder to hold it wrong than it is to hold it right you know and it's like you know the there's that scene uh in l

ike Avengers or whatever where Vision's like it's terribly well balanced you know like when he picks up Thor's hammer or whatever like damn like this this thing just kind of like selfbalances and like works quite well from that perspective. So yeah, I'm a deep believer at this point in terms of that will be the dominant species, right? Again, you know, assembly, C, C++, JavaScript words, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it feels like a big jump.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it feels like a big jump and and it is too, right? Um and I think like there's it's not like you abandon uh like CPUbased discrete logic in general and just move straight to fuzzy logic.

You you need both, right? So your skills should call code or applications or like whatever some sort of like static structure and you can use the skills to kind of distill um what the almost like procedure should be or like how the code should act right I'm kind of coming to this thesis which is you need three points essentially which is you need a clear spec of what what defines the system you need the code and then you need the tests right and I think when you say this thesis out loud it's li

ke well if you've been in engineering for any amount of time you're like well no like yeah of course you like that's that's a RFC like a request for comment that's tests and that's your code right but they all matter a lot and having them all be actually together so that they can reinforce each other and say well the spec and the tests match but the code doesn't let me reconcile them oh okay now the tests and the spec match let me go and reconcile this other thing right and you can kind of move

through that period of of basically saying well this is fuzzy and these two are either discreet in the the case of tests or slightly fuzzy slightly discreet in case of code, right? And that's kind of your iteration loop.

I think that's also incidentally why you're seeing a lot of people be like software factories and I want to write this doc and like how I go and reconcile and all this other stuff which I think is a bit of architectural astronomy if you like don't actually go in and implement it. But I do think generally that's kind of that loop is kind of where most things are going to ultimately end up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh for listeners, we've been talking about this on the podcast for 3 years.

The the holy trinity of specs and tests. Okay. Uh Adamar Freeman from uh Kodo is is the is the reference for people want to look it up. Yes. One thing I one thing I do want to mention on just on the open claw thing is uh also like the idea that you can self modify uh which is kind of interesting.

I don't know how exactly railway would support it but I do have my open claw uh and I just tell it that it has the railway CLI you can do whatever um and in theory you can just whatever capabilities or new infra you need you can just call the railway CLI provision it and add it to itself and so the agent can like modify it own infra which I think is &gt;&gt; yeah it's nuts.

We have uh we have a loop that I've kind of uh set up which is you put the rail railway CLI on top of uh something that runs on top of railway right and so you're essentially authenticated as whatever the current box is uh in in general and you can make any sort of changes to it and then you just call railway deploy and it deploys itself &gt;&gt; right like it's just like oh cool I need to go and spin up this instance of this environment I already exist in this environment excellent I've got ac

cess to a postgress instance now right like and this is kind of where we want to go with a lot of the like agentic almost like self-replic licating like infrastructure is like that's your loop. Like you iterate in production. That's your loop, right? You're going to just continue to to make some sort of change and either it will work and you're going to want to go and merge it and say cool that's great like put into our upstream or it will not work and you can just kind of throw it away etc.

Right? How do you go and make those throwaway copies like as trivial as possible to spin up run super cheap etc.

I think the the era of like I have an AWS instance and I'm going to, you know, get four vCPU and 16 gigs of RAM, it's going to get like completely destroyed, right? Because it's like if you do that for for agents or anything else like that, you now need a thousand of those machines, right? Like it's so prohibitively cost expensive versus like, you know, we spent a ton of time trying to figure out how do we go in and make these deploys, whatever you want to call them.

uh you know cloud has got the like isolates everybody's like call sandbox like whatever that like that atomic unit of deploy like only pay for what you use spin up instantaneously close loop as quickly as possible right because if the if the system can self-replicate the system and it can do so safely and say this is my environment I'm making these changes etc it can come back with hey does this look good like this is a new state of infrastructure given this prompt I think I've solved this prob

lem right and then you can go back to the agent and it actually like looks a little bit different &gt;&gt; goes and does the loop again and you're like cool excellent apply. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think I think that's retroactively obvious kind of kind of like the the most uh u useful kind. I don't know any other comments on like just like agent deployment on uh railway.

No, I mean it's it's getting better every day and you know I'm on I'm on X or Twitter or whatever you want to call it and like you can you can always you know yell at me about the experience not working uh as well as it it should because there's plenty of things that should work way way way better.

&gt;&gt; I was going to say I think at this at right at this stage in the juncture when people want like the massively or embarrassingly parallel compute they usually talk serverless and I feel like there's a no new serverless that has emerged compared to like the last the previous five years of serverless. Yep. &gt;&gt; You're kind of like in that in that new bucket kind of I don't know if you have like comparisons or philosophical differences that you want to call out.

&gt;&gt; No, I think it's like it's as you kind of mentioned it's somewhere in between, right? It's like the ability to run stateful longunning like you want to call them workflows, you want to call them executions, you want to call them whatever. Um &gt;&gt; which like Versel has fluid compute and then Cloudflare has some container thing. Yeah. Uh Google has always had uh the app runner. &gt;&gt; AppRunner and um &gt;&gt; the the new one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I forget a bunch of them. Um yeah.

Yeah. I think like that's kind of where everything roughly it and this is why we've been working on it for the last like 6 years is like we just believe like you do need access to a computer you like a a box that speaks Linux, right? Um so that you can deploy the things that you want to go in and deploy on it, right? like other things are going to I mean they're going to change the uh almost like surface area of what you can kind of go in and build and and for us we're always like no like users

need a computer and they need they need to be able to deploy anything that they truly want right and that's why we focused on a long time uh for a long time on those primitives right of like network compute and storage right because if we can give you those things and we can expose them them to you and allow you to run these things indefinitely right um that's of course like where we believe that that it's going to go in general right and So I think you're seeing right now where again the whole

like Twitter has no nuance whereas every like servers right it's servers it's like no it's like it's always it's it's always somewhere in the middle you know like it's always some sort of convergence of well I want to run it for for a long time but also I don't want to like provision this resource statically or pay for just things that I'm not using or anything else like that and that's always been our thesis from like day one is like pay only for what you use run it indefinitely it is just lik

e full full Linux basically Yeah. Yeah. I think that's why like I like the versal naming of fluid cuz like it's well it's fluid it's flexible. Um another milestone and then I wanted to ask one more technical question uh which is the Heroku official deprecation or what what did they uh basically you know you are one of the presumptive new Heroku. New Heroku has been a category for like &gt;&gt; as long as I've been in developer tooling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; It's finally happening.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. What was that like when you know is there any behind the scenes of like well this is the moment? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean you just have you have so many people just like you're just like like you were running stuff on here like you as this company you like it's crazy that like you whatever like name that you would know is running this thing and then you're coming to us be like yeah we kind of like want to like move a lot of this stuff off or whatever like okay cool.

Um but yeah it's kind of just nuts like I think &gt;&gt; any like behind the scenes on what's what is what why does Salesforce let Heroku kind of just stagnate? Well, I mean, I can only I can only like guess I guess, right? Like I mean, I think it's just hard when like it's not your business. Like the business of Salesforce is to build a really really good CRM, you know, right? And like that's their focus, right? They should be really really focused on building a really really great CRM.

And then you acquire this business as a compute business that's kind of an offshoot of your your business in general, right? And I think like you know a lot of the early meta folks have talked a lot about like focus, right? And like I think Bos has a whole like write up that he's done basically where he talks about uh in the early days of meta we had no money and like we were forced to get focused, right? And then we basically turned on the money.

This is all like you know me um &gt;&gt; verbatim. Yeah. Rephrasing or whatever. We turned on the money tree and then we had no reason to like not like have focus cuz we just had infinite money where we could go and split all of our focus, right? But that ends up diluting your product.

It ends up like making these things where you kind of have these offshoots where you're just like is that the focus of the business? Right? And it ultimately ends up not being if it's not the core of your business, right? And so to me, it's it's like kind of no wonder that like it languished in general, right? Um because it just wasn't the core focus of the business.

And I think that a lot of companies get in trouble um with this when they kind of like split out their focus in general because it it means that you're almost like fighting a like multiffronted war trying to like compete with all these things and and not just like compete with them externally but compete with them internally for like alignment and like where are we going what are we doing what is our purpose here right like if you're you know if you're really really you know like Salesforce bui

lt and you're like hey listen I love Salesforce I really want to like work on all those things like you know and you're you're mission driven which is like the the aspiration for a company in general of like why do people work on things, right? It's like they want to work on something interesting, right? Like &gt;&gt; Heroku is off to the side.

It's like it's not the core of of the business, right? And so to get those resourcing uh you know like budget or focus or alignment or whatever internally it's it's just pushed away, right? So it was it was literally just a matter of time for for it to happen uh in in our mind. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think kudos for them to like actually call it out instead of just letting it be unknown or &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Well, their whole their whole release was a little bit odd because they like, you know, they they kind of called it out our Incredible Journey. &gt;&gt; They didn't say they were like shutting it down, but they're like, "Yeah." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. And then, you know, behind the scenes, I think they issued some some stuff to people being like, "Hey, yeah, you should like close these accounts down. Like, we are going to go in and defecate this and like remove it every time." So, yeah.

I mean it's just like and it's crazy because like some of my first deployment experiences were like on Heroku like it's like a foundational thing where &gt;&gt; I had a freaking alias in my bash for like Heroku deployments. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.

Like you you start with like dragging stuff into an FTP server and then like you move on to like trying to get a deploy working like how do I go and make this happen and it's like Heroku, right? &gt;&gt; Did you know about Heroku hacks and &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Right.

Like and and you learn about all this and it was the on-ramp for us, right? Um you know but the wheel turns regardless, right? like there's there's new stuff that's emerging and like we're very very happy to like almost like continue to like you know carry the torch on for a lot of that stuff but we we don't want to be the new Heroku we want to be the way in which people are building and deploying software and ultimately the way that people monetize software over time right &gt;&gt; I mean it's

a big crown to be a new Heroku like there's like 50 companies that fought for this &gt;&gt; oh yeah everybody's kind of like you know holding some portion of this being like ah you know um but yeah I think you know for us we're we're just happy to go and support people companies etc. um the platform works a bit differently. So it's like you know it's it's obviously kind of almost this the similar kind of like game loop. Exactly. Right.

Um but we've been quite dogmatic in terms of where we believe these things are going to go in terms of uh primitives you know the the agents uh kind of fan off all of those other things. Right. And so some things will fit and then some things will you know you have to change a few of the workloads etc. Like we don't have uh and what's that feature that people really love? &gt;&gt; Pipelines. &gt;&gt; Heroku. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.

Um like we have some approximation of it with the environment system in general. Right. But yeah, so it's it's been super exciting. We've got a ton of people that we're able to go and support. So and it's growing a lot. Um so &gt;&gt; yeah. Any other technical I I have one more bug. Temporal. Okay. So Temporal I have sold my shares. &gt;&gt; Uh you are a power user. You you're one of our earliest customers. I think I met you through temporal or something.

You are a big temporal business like you build on temporal. have uh complaints. I think this is the neutral, most neutral, most informed art um conversation that anyone will ever hear about Temporal without someone working at the company. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fair. &gt;&gt; It's the two of us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I think that's fair. &gt;&gt; What's your &gt;&gt; So, I I have used Temporal for almost like 10 years now, right? Because like Cadence, all of us other things.

&gt;&gt; At just just give people a scale of what Cadence is at Uber like people people don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so cadence was the precursor to temporal and it powers like all of the trip actions, the rides, the like you know when you you like rent a jump bike or scooter like any anything else like that or a car.

It's like you're running these workflows for a period of time and you're basically saying this ride will run for an indefinite period until it like finishes, right? And you can go and attach information whether it's like oh you paused it in this zone and so you know you need to add this dollar charge to like the the bill or anything else like that and then when you end the trip like your workflow is done right that whole experience uh behind the scenes I don't know about today in general but it

was like powered by by cadence at that point in time and so it's a really really like &gt;&gt; Yeah and I used to say like it's like imagine if you could program the entire user journey top down as one function. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's such a it's such a powerful idea and it's so so important.

It's also incidentally so important for the next uh phase of the agentic journey where like you want an agent to do a specific task and then you want it to like be complete or incomplete on that task and then move on to the next thing, right? Like you need a way to be able to go in and manage these workflows. You need a way to be able to go and manage these workflows dynamically.

And I think for me temporal was always like really really really great in theory and it was really really great when you got it working the way that you wanted to in production. It's just it required you to like model that entire journey in your head.

And if you didn't have the entire journey in your head, you could put yourself in a spot where you would cause like issues where like replaying the state of the entire workflow like causes like a nondeterminism issue &gt;&gt; because it works on like deterministic workflow history. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Right. Um and so it's very very easy.

It's like the the way that I kind of like would describe it is like well it's a jet engine, right? Like if you know how to like go in and operate, if you know how to go and run it, all of those other things, right? you can't hand it to people who are trying to build things that end up being complicated but don't have that whole kind of like state in their head, right? Um so if you have a large like we run our whole deployment pipeline on on top of it, right? And so that's like a reasonably comp

licated workflow, right? Like there's uh pre-commit hooks, there's like signaling, there's queuing, there's like all of this other stuff in in general, right? And we kind of ran into the same thing at Uber where like as you tried to express this large workflow as you mentioned like going all the way down got more and more complicated and it got more and more states in the state machine that you had to like map the state machine back to like the the right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.

If that &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so so at Uber we built a system for you know doing the the state machine and like testing the state machine and all that other stuff. And we've started to like go and build some of those things here because like it's it's grown uh you know quite heavily. Right. It's like it's such a like, you know, I don't want to say love hate relationship cuz that's like too broad in in general.

Like it's when it works really really well, it works like super super well, right? But then you run into a spot where you just like somebody who hasn't interacted with the system or doesn't have the full context of the system goes and puts something in the system that invalidates some of the state or causes a non-determined issue non-determinism issue or um spins off a ton of activities or anything else like that.

And then you have to kind of keep track of like almost underlying S sur knobs of like oh we have uh you know the amount of activity slots in in this thing right it's like well these should just scale with like memory vpu all of those other things in general right so it ends up becoming a bit of a bear to to kind of scale out in general &gt;&gt; yeah so you need like a very capable sis admin running things behind the scenes for you &gt;&gt; yeah yeah &gt;&gt; if you were to move off what would y

ou do &gt;&gt; I think we would build our own workflow uh uh we have a few internally um that that we've kind like worked on.

So yeah, because it's like yeah, &gt;&gt; this this is one of those things where like you know this one of those classes of things where like you you typically wouldn't vibe code it, but I'm wondering if &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think you should vibe code it still like you still want to run like uh types tests and stuff like that like to make sure that like you &gt;&gt; I mean you know like it's not like Turbo had to invent that from scratch either, right? Like &gt;&gt; so like there's libraries

for those things Yeah. that you can that you can run and like on top of that it's just a state machine and you know that you that you have to really map out but ultimately you define those abstractions that you want and you run it through a state machine and that's it. &gt;&gt; Y like &gt;&gt; yeah it's it's very very doable. Um so yeah I think the workflow stuff is very very interesting like there's a few really cool companies I think like restate's doing some neat stuff here.

Um &gt;&gt; so you're very tied into JavaScript you're like a JavaScript maxi &gt;&gt; internally we have JavaScript we have or we have TypeScript we have Rust and we have Go. Those are three languages, right? We don't add any more stuff. Actually, that's not true. We have a little bit of C because we write BPF code and and like and its hooks and stuff like that.

So, um but those are those are the the kind of um &gt;&gt; is this for this like the side container things side car stuff? &gt;&gt; No. Well, so this is for uh the networking stack as well as the uh volumes and and stuff like that.

Um, so yeah, but it's like yeah, we we used like the TypeScript stuff a lot because it it's like what powers the dashboard, but we're going to move a lot of the kind of workflow stuff off of the kind of dashboard stack into actually the infrastructure stack where recently Yeah. Don't power things on front end, guys. Even though it's free compute. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Any other technical infrastructure cool stuff? Rail packs. I don't know if that's still uh &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, we built that engine for determining uh dependencies based on your source code, which is super cool. It's called Railpack. We built the first version called Nyxpacks, which is on top of Nyx. Uh, and then yeah, we moved. &gt;&gt; People have been trying to get me to adopt Nyx and Nix OS for like 4 years. &gt;&gt; Is it going to ever going to be a thing? &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know.

like we were super excited about it in general, but it's like it has bunch of different uh kind of uh pain points in general cuz if you just think of it, it's like it's a it's a stack of version source code at or it's a stack of version binary at specific slices in time, right? And so if you want version X and version Y, you end up bloating a lot of your kind of uh like package like space, right? Which blows up the size of your images and and makes it really really difficult um for like really

real world workloads. I think if you &gt;&gt; but you you know you you content address it, you cache it. It's you know there's there's a lot of optimizations that in theory you should be able to do &gt;&gt; in theory. Yes. Right.

Um and what what happens ultimately is like you have a large enough user base and you have a disperate enough set of uh machines that you kind of run into the the problem that uh there's a paper that Meta released uh XF AS like internal uh kind of like um serverless uh system.

it becomes it ends up being being very very difficult to go in and and do that at scale unless you break out specific runtimes &gt;&gt; basically um which we uh did not want to go in and and do right because we wanted to truly allow you to deploy anything right which was our initial kind of thing with Nyx uh but we've moved towards some interesting stuff that I think we'll we'll be able to talk about a little bit later um that we've we've built for doing context addressable file systems to be a

ble to like lazy load um anything from any point um and then just uh page that into memory. &gt;&gt; Amazing. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to be fun. There's the whole future is very very bright. It's it's crazy. It's it's going to be nuts. Uh okay. Founder journey stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And your uh cloud usage. You tweeted you're going to spend 300k this month. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think we got I think we got two &gt;&gt; coding agents &gt;&gt; across the company. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

You only have 35 people. So I'm sure they're not all spending 10K a month. What's kind of like the distribution? &gt;&gt; I think I'm at about 25 uh in in general. Um and then we have some, you know, power users kind of all all the way down.

I don't know like we came back and from from the winter break and I was basically like if you are writing code by hand you are doing this wrong right like your code the tools are good enough at this point like that you can move extremely extremely quickly and like yes there are issues and pain points and all these other things um but you should be hand like all of those architectural patterns all of those other things like whatever actually they matter more now than and than any other time.

But you looks like you would have written it yourself, right? And I think incidentally like people misconstrue uh my propensity to like push people towards agents for like hey we're growing really really fast and we've had some kind of like bumps in rel like they're not necessarily related uh in terms of that.

Um, but I think people should really really understand like the tools are good enough for you to be able to move extremely extremely quickly to build things way way larger than you could have possibly built before, right? Um, and so to our point about way earlier about like how do you cool data centers in space? It's like well I don't know actually, right? Um, but you're at a point now with with software you can actually be like well how would I build block storage from scratch? How would I go

in and do these things? I have ideas because I've got history. I've read all these papers in general, right? let me go and work them out in general and let me build like massive test benches with like thousands of tests, right? Because they're free to they're free to author right now, right? To go in and make sure that like this system can now can can be built, right? And I think that if you're not using the the kind of AI systems to almost like speedrun your road map to like go in and figure ou

t where you need to go in and be to reconcile your existing system onto the future, then you're kind of missing a large point of of what is currently happening right now, right? because you can just template out anything and validate it on the side for free, right? &gt;&gt; What's the path to spend 3 million a month? Like is it bound by like ideas and things that the customers can absorb? &gt;&gt; I think for for most companies it's actually bound by deployment at this point in time.

And I think that's why we've seen a lot of like a massive bo in terms of like users trying like &gt;&gt; not just users like companies like you know fortune 50s like you know below etc like going and being like how do we get our developers to like go in and move quicker right? Um, I think you're probably going to hit um your CFO before you hit uh any of these limits in general cuz they're going to look at this and be like there's an eye watering amount of like money being spent on these tokens.

Like I think uh I don't know which I think it was the Uber CL token budget for the entire year or whatever, right? Um and so inference has costs have to come down, but &gt;&gt; they're also you know we're inference constrained at this point in time, right? And so you're going to almost get this like price discovery of like what makes sense for an or to go and adopt. And I think what you're going to end up with is actually you're going to almost like end up with the like F1 driver concept.

Um which is if you have a if you have somebody who's like really really adept at these things, uh it makes sense to go and put them into like a $3 million car or whatever, right? But if you're not, then like it probably doesn't actually make sense for you to go and do that. And we're going to take a few of these people and say you drive the F1 car. We need to go in this general direction.

figure out if this works and like almost go ahead and prototype it, right? Um, and so we've done a few of those things where like we've vastly accelerated our road map in terms of, oh, we thought we were going to be able to go in and ship this thing in the next like few years, but actually we can probably ship it in the next like few months now, right? Because we're saying, oh, validated it out, it works. We don't have to even like build it incrementally.

We can now skip steps to like go and just move towards where our vision is for a lot of this stuff. And I think that that's kind of where you end up with a lot of it, you know? Yeah, I think a lot of people are realizing the road map doesn't always have a business impact. And so it's like, oh, it's too expensive to run these tokens, but like if your road map was actually built to make more money by the time you built the whole thing, you would have some sort of token pricing for it.

The same way you do with sales, &gt;&gt; like you would spend a billion dollars in sales if you knew you would get $2 billion of revenue out of it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.

Um, and I I think the the the really naive way to go in and measure this is almost like your percentage of tokens that end up in production, &gt;&gt; right? And so if you can measure that you are getting this level of of impact because those tokens are ending up in production, that's awesome, right? Um but I think the the kind of burden of proof is now going to kind of like arise.

And you see it internally too on our stuff like we have a growing number of pull requests that like &gt;&gt; are are like haven't yet been merged, right? And you're just like, okay, how do you get this into production, right? Um and so it's really about like how quickly you can go and kind of build and deploy that software, right? Um which is exciting because our whole deploy software, &gt;&gt; we build and deploy software, you know, right? So yeah.

Yeah, the SDLC is changing and it's something that both of us are like super interested in exploring as well. Um, my one of my thesis or it's not my thesis, it's the pull request is dying, &gt;&gt; right? It's it's going to be the prompt request.

&gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; and then beyond that code review is also kind of dying because do you really need to uh if you have all the other systems in place? What else is changing about the SDLC? &gt;&gt; What else is different? Well, I think the &gt;&gt; AIS &gt;&gt; AISR the tools to to make So the AISR is like one of those things where it's like, you know, it's a pie in the sky aspirational.

What What does it take to get an AIS? Like what? &gt;&gt; By the way, you should expose your tooling to your customers at some point, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh which tooling? &gt;&gt; Uh central command center. &gt;&gt; Oh, central station.

&gt;&gt; That like we So we have it for template maintainers, right? So template maintainers can like deploy and maintain templates and they get feedback on a lot of that stuff, right? And so we're 100% like going to go in and expose those things like incrementally. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, but like you know clustering around incidents like everyone has a version of that but like I don't think anyone solved it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right.

Um and I don't want to say we've solved it internally but it's gotten it's gotten so good that like now we can see uh those incidents forbing like pretty quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Real time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so at some point those will those will be things that either somebody else goes and builds or we go in and build.

But we've always built stuff that like was purpose-built for us and if it made sense and and there was a way to go in and make it useful for users or monetize it or or make sure that that loop becomes like a profit center instead of a cost center like we want to go and and do that at some point, right? Um so yeah is definitely dying.

&gt;&gt; Do you do first party uh feature flagging and um incremental rollout type stuff as well? &gt;&gt; So we have a feature flagging engine that we built internally that at some point we will we will roll &gt;&gt; because I don't see it as a user. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so &gt;&gt; so like that, you know, &gt;&gt; that would be that's good, right? &gt;&gt; How come you didn't give us what you have? &gt;&gt; Well, because because we have to we have to beta test it.

Like we actually care a lot a lot a lot about the quality of the the things. There's plenty of stuff that like we've used internally and then we've got it to a point where like it did it doesn't make its way entirely through the journey because it fails, right? It's it's like this this holds for one service, but it doesn't hold for multiple services, right? So we'd have to go and build these things for multiple services to go and make this work, right? And we know for a fact that if we release

this thing, we'd have to go and rebuild this thing again and again and again. And some things are worth doing to go in and do that. But a lot of them are basic like that also that kind of just informs our road map of okay well like for us to go and make that actually a bit easier.

We can do the a few of these things first and then we get to that experience, right? Um we don't want to dilute the experience by basically saying like oh yeah this works but only for this service, right? um unless it's like a very very core initiative which is like you know over the next like few months we're going to roll out a few things that are like okay it works for a single service and then it works for multiple services and then it works multiple service across the environment right um

but you have to be very very deliberate about those things otherwise you end up with a bunch of broken disparate experiences which ultimately end up creating a ton of support load because people are like how do I use this feature how do I go in and do this other stuff right um so it's kind of the the thing earlier about like you expand your company in general to to get those like features and then almost compact it, smooth out those things so the experience is like really really stellar.

Like we were talking in the hallway earlier where you're like, "Oh my god, it's gotten so much better." And I'm like, "Oh man, like just internally we're like, "Damn, this part's really sucks." Um, we got to make this significantly significantly better. &gt;&gt; No, I can I can attest uh, you know, over the last 3 years that I've uh, watched you build in railway.

Uh, but yeah, no, I would call to to listeners if you're not aware like the importance of feature flagging, it's a very part big part of Uber culture. So much so that they have too many feature flags and then they have another thing to remove feature flags. &gt;&gt; Yep. 100%. &gt;&gt; What was it? There's a there's a paper about this &gt;&gt; flagger and and there's there's been another one. &gt;&gt; There's a thing that like looks &gt;&gt; Facebook has gatekeeper. Uh yeah.

So they're they're really important &gt;&gt; and agents are going to need this. That's like the fundamental thing behind, you know, like just incremental rollouts. Yep. &gt;&gt; Openi acquired statig. Yep. Uh, and this basically GBZ5 is just routing and flagging, you know, through through different models.

And like that's like &gt;&gt; and it's it's super important, right? Because if you if you assume &gt;&gt; the the software development life cycle is 100% going to go in and change, but it's going to change because we're trying to do things a thousand times faster and a thousand times more concurrent than we were currently doing, right? And so routing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.

Um, and so what ends up becoming important at scale, you know, before I even, you know, started railway, I actually built a feature flagging product and I tried I tried to go and sell it to people, right? Cuz I was like, oh, it's like a, you know, like it's an easier version of like Launch Darkly or whatever, right? And I ran into this situation which is like &gt;&gt; anybody who's small enough to adopt your technology doesn't care about feature flags, right? And then anybody who's large enough

to try and actually need feature flags needs so much scale that you have to like build out all the existing infrastructure. So end up scrapping that. But it's what is old is is new again because now companies are trying to move really really quickly. But you can't just yolo this like vibecoded thing straight into production. You need to basically say, "Hey, here's my blast radius. Here's my impact. Here's my like whatever.

I want to shadow it for these users." Right? Feature flags, right? like you're going to need those tools that ultimately those larger companies ended up having to go in and build to maintain their structures.

Everything's just going to get compressed by like a thousandx so that everybody can go and do that and everybody can build those structures really really quickly, right? And that's like exactly where we're at right now is like you're compressing the software development life cycle and then we're going to expand it and and add way more new things to it, you know? &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Uh and then the other term that comes to mind with when this kind of discussion happens for me for newer developers who haven't heard this term cattle not pets. &gt;&gt; Right. Because like your prod like it has a name like a baby, you know, I have to keep it alive. But when it's cattle, you can just mass farm and you can like roll out and you can like, you know, uh portion out parts of them and kill them or whatever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

Um I actually I actually think that maybe that's the the hot take, but I think that that's actually going to change. And I think you can move towards having pets so long as uh you have a and this is going to be a jump. So long as you have a cloning machine for your pets. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Yeah. Yeah.

If you can snapshot every single thing at every frame, then like it actually doesn't matter if you know that obliterated because you have some sort of like snapshot of it, right? All of the things that we have built right now are to essentially block out uh any sort of um changes or alterations or whatever from that like hermetically sealed DevOps like line or whatever.

It's like okay well you have to write a docker file because I only need these specific instance like only this specific cut of the file system etc right what if you just had the whole file system what if you just snapshot it and what if you lazily load the entirety of the file system right then you can get around this problem entirely you don't need the ceremony of those you know having a docker file or like having anible script or like having all of these other things you can just iterate on t

hat loop and then like snapshot it is like is this the right loop is this the right thing at this point in time okay cool like now I'm going to go and merge it in production like go merge the file system. &gt;&gt; Yeah, why not? &gt;&gt; It's going to be really fun.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is like a whole other kind of worms, but like I think the number of things that are stateful in a VM, uh I think if you just kind of catalog them and just like develop dedicated solutions for solving each of them, you can actually kind of cut this down problem down a lot. And it's surprising that people weren't really trying until now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so it's it's surprising.

I mean, it's always been surprising to me because these are the things that we work on cuz they're just like I'm like it's so obvious. &gt;&gt; First principles, you need them. Everyone like in theory needs them. And then like the big clouds don't do them. So you're like it's impossible or something. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Right. You're like oh well they you know meta has all the people who write like you know ebpf code and and they're like doing something with them.

Um you know but like you need that kind of stuff to solve these problems, right? And and like talked about earlier it's like whatever is required however deep we have to go and like get to like solve those problems right like all the way down to like the kernel TCP IP stack right like we're going to go and figure that out.

Is there something that we need to go in and modify to like go in and make that work for the mental model that we have for the universe moving forward? Like yeah, 100% we're going to go in and do it. We'll just keep going. &gt;&gt; Sounds fun. &gt;&gt; It's super fun. It's like it's so much fun. Like I have to literally peel myself away from the fun interesting problems that we have to make sure that we can scale the company in a way that like works.

And there's so many different fun interesting problems whether it is like how do you get the information from the customer to um support to the person who built the thing internally, right? Um or it's like how do you get do iteration or how do you get context like from the dashboard to users or like how do you drill down all the way to the infrastructure layer? How do you manage orchestration as like a real-time operating system versus a feedback control system, right? Like it's just so fun, yo

u know? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean speaking of maybe talk about the founder side. Um you're famously like you know the YC uh the SF consensus is you go to YC you get a co-founder you do all these things. Uh you've done none of that. &gt;&gt; No I've Yeah I've I've like done a lot of different things in general right &gt;&gt; in the in the elevator you were like actually co-founder it kind of makes sense if like one person is the tech person the other is the bisdev person. Yep.

&gt;&gt; And but you have to contain all those multitudes yourself. &gt;&gt; How do you do it? &gt;&gt; Okay. I was going to ask is there a question in there or what? Yeah. Um the question is what the hell how do you do it? Um &gt;&gt; the question is how how are you alive right now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I mean yeah I mean just try to get eight hours of sleep.

Uh you know &gt;&gt; is there like a balance that you ideally like 50/50 30 like what what's the mental model that you use as a balance.

There's like you just you just have to think about all these things and and be obsessed with all of these things like whether it is being obsessed with like how do people think about your product from a go to market perspective or being obsessed from a perspective of like well like if I can make this change at the like kernel level then I can make it so that the user's SSH connection never drops right like because that's what I want like I want a universe in which I can go and like snapshot all

these things and it looks exactly like you would just kind of iterate on on a VM right and I think you just have to obsessed with all those things like at every layer of of the stack. And I think that's what makes it easier for me.

I think some people like they're obsessed with different portions of the the kind of like journey c like the company like whatever, right? And I think that that's when you can get really really good almost like cohesion by like segmenting out these things, right? And so you know in the elevator I was talking about like you know you have a technical kind of like person etc.

and then you have the customer kind of like person in general, right? Um, and I think like if you can segment those lines out really really well and you can be very very clear about what your areas of ownership are for yourself or your, you know, company or like just where you're going to operate, you're going to have a good time, right? If you can't be clear about those things, right? And this is why I was saying like two is the worst number of co-founders is because you have no tiebreak, righ

t? You you basically are like, well, I disagree on this thing and I disagree on this thing, right? It's like, well, how do you resolve that? Right. If &gt;&gt; Well, you say someone's CEO, right? &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Then you're like, okay, you have to tiebreaker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Totally. I mean, listen, it's hard. It's hard every single way you cut it, right? It's hard it's hard if you get help. It's hard if you do it yourself.

It's it's just it's just hard to like run things roughly speaking, right? But it's so rewarding. It's so fun, you know? &gt;&gt; What have you found useful? Like a coach. Um any advice that has been really helpful? &gt;&gt; I like to write a lot. Um I I got in trouble. I get in trouble a lot for my Twitter. Um I think there's a pattern. &gt;&gt; Who do you get in trouble with? &gt;&gt; The people on on Twitter, you know.

Um, you know, I was talking about it and I was like, "Hey, if you, you know, if you're working weekends, you're kind of messing up your planning roughly, right? Um, and I've gone kind of back and forths on that, right? Because I think actually right now we're kind of at an extenduating time in general where it actually makes sense to like work &gt;&gt; more, right? Because the the goals are pretty clear in in my mind, right? Um, and so if you have the vision and you know where you're going, you

should work a little bit harder to distill that vision and go and do those things. But if you don't have the like we're we're like I think we should be going this journey. I'm not 100% certain. I want to get a little bit of clarity. I think what you need to do is you need to like disconnect and you need to take your weekends like very very seriously.

You need to write about where are you, what do you want to do, where do you want to go, what problems are you trying to go and solve and like think about a lot of these things, right? So, um you know writing is important.

uh sitting down like I I don't like the word like meditation or whatever but like whatever gets you into the the state of like your mental clarity like that's the thing that's like really really important when you're trying to go on these journeys of of saying well we're here and we really need to be be here in in general or like we're here and I think we need to be roughly in this kind of like space for this to like work right so those are the things and then you know disconnect hang out with

the people that you love and then like work super super hard when when you're like you know like I try and work like sun up to sun down Monday to Friday all out in general and then I try and disconnect on Saturday and then I come back to work on uh Sunday afternoon, right? And then I do my writing plan for the week, all those other things. And it works really really well for me.

Um but another hot take is like most advice is to be digested and to be thrown out the window and if it's helpful, it'll come back, right? If it's helpful, you'll have kind of like learned it over time through experience or anything else like that. But yeah, you mentioned like the the kind of standard, you know, YC advice, all of those other things.

We have a lot like we've made failure as a society very very expensive and it makes it difficult for people to kind of trod off the paths right so &gt;&gt; yeah makes sense &gt;&gt; any other soft books you want to get on like anything that you have not tweeted and gotten in trouble with that you want to preview to the world &gt;&gt; no I think the the agent stuff is like it's just like it's crazy it's it's going to be it's going to be the dominant way in which people are doing pretty much ever

ything right um provided we and of course get the amount of inference required for for that to go and and happen. Uh but over the next like 10 years, right, you just you see a fundamental shift in terms of how people are thinking about even just authoring the logic that's in their head, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. My you know, maybe one one way of phrasing this is if all birds can become a GPU provider, so can Realway. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

I think there's a lot of horror in us actually not becoming a GPU provider. I think I think you're you're defined almost more by the things that you don't do than the things that you do because it's it's really really easy for you to just say yes to a bunch of different things, right? And I think like it's going to be very very interesting to watch uh you know I I think Anthropic is like an amazing company and like super super stellar and they're moving into a variety of different zones, right?

They're moving into like the Figma kind of like stuff that they're they're after, right? Yes. As &gt;&gt; of was on Figma's board and then they removed him like Monday and then they launched this today. Yeah. So I mean things things move very very fast uh right now. Um so but yeah it's just going to be the way in which people are &gt;&gt; okay. So so your answer is focus. No GPUs for now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Focus. Never say never. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right.

Um like I can tell you for a fact that we will not be doing GPUs now, but we 100% will be doing GPUs at some point in the future. And and that's not like me leaking our road map because we don't have plans to go and do GPUs.

It's just a function of at some point you need flops, right? like at some point you want like if you're fully vertically integrated and you want to make it really really trivial for people to go and iterate and build and deploy things you need access to this core piece of fundamental logic right um so yeah and then like at at some point uh presumably the your own data center traffic is like a minority of your workload right now but is there like a majority or you know you just kind of completel

y turn off &gt;&gt; oh at some point we got to 100% data center like our own data centers Yeah. Yeah. Um it's and it's right now it's the vast majority of the stuff that exists on on our our bareband data centers, right? So &gt;&gt; So you're already there like vast majority. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Um I didn't I didn't know that the extent of the transition. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Totally.

It was completed at some point and then we grew so fast um that we had to basically like go and and scale back on on that. &gt;&gt; Take us back. Sorry, Google Cloud. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was funny. Like we got it was funny. We got to like on on the data dog dashboard it's like it got to 100% and then it like divoted back down into the like '9s or whatever cuz we're like &gt;&gt; adding capacity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's interesting.

You're you're literally building a new cloud and that's independent and people assume that that could never happen post you know the AWS. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and it's and it's hard right like you know we we we're going to you know figure out a bunch of different things uh to to make sure that like the platform is deeply deeply reliable.

you have to break ground on a on a lot of new things when you basically decide you're going to build a cloud from scratch but not copy the hyperscalers, right? Like we've been very very deliberate to like invent our own infrastructure from scratch based on reading a ton of papers in general but like almost like promising to ourselves that we wouldn't copy somebody else's homework, right? Um because we were saying, "Hey, listen, you know, if we if we if we copy somebody else, we lose.

Like we just you're just going to become them over time, right?" And so you have to have a core thesis about like why does this business need to go and exist at this point in time. And for us it's always been about the activation energy to get something to go and deployed in production at any of the hyperscalers as as of right now is far too high, right? And we believe that it should be instantaneous.

We believe that there should be no friction in between what your thought is and reality that kind of comes out that you can share with your friends, right? Um and so that's that's what we're kind of like building toward again at every layer of the stack.

Like if we got to go down to energy, we'll go down to energy at some point, right? Like it it just it matters a lot for us from from the experience of of giving people access to this tooling because it's it's gated behind like it's not even just gated for regular kind of like these citizen developers that are now vibe coding. It's like you have multiple layers.

You have the citizen developer, you have the front end developer, you have the backend developer, you have a devops person, you all of these layers, right? And they all need to go in and disappear so people can just like ship like that. &gt;&gt; Amazing. All right, that's the future of cloud. Thank you. Thank you for having me. It's been wonderful.
